# eGUI Layout Study Notes

## Bottom-Up Layout with Left Alignment

In eGUI, the `ui.with_layout(egui::Layout::bottom_up(egui::Align::LEFT), |ui| { ... })` method is used to arrange UI elements in a specific way:

### Key Concepts:
- **Bottom-Up Layout**: Elements are stacked from the bottom of the available space upwards. This means the last element added appears at the bottom, and previous elements are placed above it.
- **Left Alignment**: Within each row or element, content is aligned to the left side of the container.

### Example Usage:
```rust
ui.with_layout(egui::Layout::bottom_up(egui::Align::LEFT), |ui| {
    powered_by_egui_and_eframe(ui);
    egui::warn_if_debug_build(ui);
});
```

### Behavior:
- The `powered_by_egui_and_eframe` function (which displays "Powered by egui and eframe") will be positioned at the bottom.
- The `egui::warn_if_debug_build` warning will appear above it, still aligned to the left.
- This layout ensures that footer-like content stays at the bottom of the central panel, with left alignment for a clean, consistent appearance.

### Why Use This Layout?
- Useful for placing status messages, credits, or warnings at the bottom of a UI section.
- Maintains left alignment for readability and visual consistency.
- Allows dynamic content to be added without disrupting the overall layout structure.
